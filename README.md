### Descrption:

Started by Dr. Rick Engel and Dr. Perry Miller, an ongoing replicated block design study, nicknamed the Greenhouse Gas Rotational Study (GGRS) was implemented  in 2003 at the MSU-Arthur Post Research Farm near Bozeman, MT. Here, nine different crop rotations have been established and repeated since 2003 (Table 1). These treatments consist of two fallow-wheat rotations under tilled and no-till management, and five annual cropping systems under no-till management, and alfalfaâ€“perennial grass system used to mimic land in the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP). Nitrogen fertilizer management was also a big factor in this study leading to a split-plot design with two nitrogen fertilizer levels, recommended N rate and half recommended N rate. Rotation number eight was excluded because it was an organic plot with no nitrogen additions.

The Ewing laboratory of Montana State University acquired the role of interpreting existing soil sample results and taking new ones from the Engel et. al. study by testing the same plots from the study in two critical years, 2012 and 2016, when all of the plots were planted in winter wheat (see Table 1). Testing soil in this time frame allows for a window into the accumulations of total carbon (TC), total nitrogen (TN), organic carbon (OC), and inorganic carbon (IC) to be evaluated with no bias from the current crops present at that time.
