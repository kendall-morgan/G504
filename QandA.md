## Lab 04 Questions

#### 1. What Licensing Agreement did you choose and why?

> I chose the Creative Commons Zero v1.0 Universal because I wanted Dr. Sproles to be able to see my work for this lab, but I also wanted to play with a liscening I had not used before that is widely accesible. This will make it easy when I work on this data set with the help of another grad sudent this semester. Although, looking back I think may have chosen a more guarded option so that I could work on the data in private with speecific collaborators and then make the raw data along with the resulting data analysis avaiable so no one sees the data mid-analysis and throws me in the looney bin for my strange data processing habits.

#### 2. What data archiving options are recommended by the Montana State University Library?

> MSU recommends using a trustworthy data repository - mainly those that were mentioned in the paper we read on FAIR Principles for class today. These include Dryad, Zenod, ICPSR, or repositories specific to your discipline.

#### 3. How would using GitHub help make your data/code align with FAIR Protocols?

> GitHub allows you to make your Data widely accesible according to the FAIR prrinciples as you can put a link to your github repository in yor published work (F),there arre only certain types of files (such as .csv) that are accesible to all computers (A, I), and all of the data comes with valuable metadata that explains your methods and the nature of the data (R).

#### 4. What are the advantages of making your data/code more widely accessible?

> The advantage is it moves science as a whole forward. There is a crisis in both reproducibilty and access to data sets causing unchecked errors in data that are then unknowlingly accepted and compounded in some instances. Making my data and code more accessible could help just one person improve their data processing in my field, identify issues I did not originally see, or it could end up contributing to large compiled data sets that feed into powerful models that change our outlook on how the world functions.

#### 5. What are the disadvantages of making your data/code more widely accessible?

> Disadvantages could include not being correctly cited or having your data misused and attempted to be published poorly. 

#### 6. What data/code from your grad project would you envision publishing on GitHub?

> I envision publishing my code for processing soil CO2 fluxes using a clear chamber that requires manual data selection. I would also like to publish my soil Carbon inventory data sets as this is simple and usable information in many settings 

#### 7. What data/code would you not publish? Why?

> I am not sure what data I will choose not to publish as I still have a year left, but I likely wont publish experimental, non-peer reviewed data to avoid accidently leading anyone astray.
